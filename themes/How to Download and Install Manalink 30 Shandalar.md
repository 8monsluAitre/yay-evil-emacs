If you are interested in learning more about Shandalar, here are some tips and tricks to help you get started:

- Shandalar is a large and diverse world with many regions, towns, dungeons and secrets to explore. You can travel by foot, horse, boat or magic portal. You can also use the map to see your location and quest objectives.
- You start the game with a small collection of cards and a low life total. You can increase both by winning duels, buying cards from shops, finding cards in chests or rewards, or completing quests. You can also trade cards with other mages or sell them for gold.
- You can duel any mage you encounter in the world, except for some friendly ones. You can also challenge the guardians of dungeons or special locations for rare cards and rewards. Be careful though, as some mages are more powerful than others and may have special abilities or rules.
- You can customize your deck at any time by accessing the deck editor from the menu. You can also save up to four different decks and switch between them before a duel. You can use any card you own in your deck, regardless of color or rarity.
- You can choose from five different difficulty levels: Apprentice, Mage, Archmage, Wizard and Planeswalker. The higher the difficulty, the more challenging the duels and quests will be, but also the more rewarding. You can change the difficulty at any time from the options menu.
- You can save your progress at any time by accessing the save menu from the menu. You can also load a previous save or start a new game from the same menu. You can have up to four different save files.

Shandalar is a fun and immersive mode that offers hours of gameplay and replay value. Whether you want to collect all the cards, complete all the quests, defeat all the enemies, or just explore the world, you will find something to enjoy in Shandalar.
