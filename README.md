# Version-2-Emacs-Config

### P.s. Version 1 is less customized and is deprecated in favour of a clean washup that resulted in this repo.

### Intro
Thanks for dropping by! This is my personal Emacs configuration (I'm using GNU Emacs 26.2), tailored to suit my needs. I've documented (as detailed as possible) what each
function does in my `config.org` file.

### "Rolling" Release
I will constantly push new commits since *a real Emacser* is never completely satisfied with his setup (*LOL*)

### The file structure in a few words: 

My `init.el` requires `config.el`(produced by org-babel + `config.org`) and `custom.el`
(I configured the path to which the settings changed by Custom will all be extracted and written.)

### Some Screenshots of my set up and my Emacs
P.s. Also check out my self-made theme at https://github.com/ianpan870102/Emacs-Tron-Legacy-Theme
