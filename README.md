# Version-2-Emacs-Config
## Coming back from dead

This is my personal Emacs configuration, tailored to suit my needs. I've documented (as detailed as possible) what each
function does in my `config.org` file.

**The file structure in a few words**: My `init.el` requires `config.el`(produced by org-babel + `config.org`) and `custom.el`
(I configured the path to which the settings changed by Custom will all be extracted and written.)
